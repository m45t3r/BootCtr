Homebrew Launcher emergency boot
By mashers at GBATemp
Based on 3DS Homebrew Launcher code by Smealum

Installation:
Rename the boot.3dsx file already on your SD card to boot1.3dsx
Place some other launcher or FTP client in the root of your SD card and call it emergency.3dsx
Copy the file boot.3dsx from this archive to the root of your SD card

Usage:
Boot up your homebrew hax as usual
If you do nothing, then boot1.3dsx will be launched (your normal launcher)
If something goes wrong with your launcher, hold down the right shoulder button while launching your homebrew hax
This will cause emergency.3dsx to be booted instead
